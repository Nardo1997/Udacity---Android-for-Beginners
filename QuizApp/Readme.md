# Educational App

This is the project of the course Android for Beginners of Udacity in which I created a quiz of Spain. It includes TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText and RadioButton. It also shows the score obtained over 100 and does not allow you to send more than one submission of the quiz. It shows the correct questions (green warning) and incorrect questions (red warning). And finally a button to restart punctuation and clear questions to be able to do it again.
